                I have a bachelor's degree in graphic design and have always
                been very fascinated with AR filters on Snapchat and Instagram
                so when I found out that Facebook’s Spark AR platform has moved
                out of its closed beta and designers are able to publish their
                own Spark AR effects on the platform I immediately decided to
                dedicate at least 4-8 hours a day to learning everything I can
                about the platform and start creating.

                So, Kylie Jenner bought the rights to your filter. How did you
                make that happen?
              </p>
              <p class="csm-ans">
                I am a huge Kylie fan. She’s the main reason I started posting
                makeup looks on Instagram and I own almost every shade of the
                Kylie Cosmetics Lip Kits! I was up at 6am on January 7th with my
                1 year old daughter and saw Kylie had just posted a story about
                the Stormi Collection with three beautiful moving butterflies in
                her hair. I found the look SO beautiful and immediately wanted
                to recreate that look as a filter. I started right away to draw
                the butterflies and animate them and then recreate Kylie's
                beautiful makeup, which was done by Ariel Tejada her makeup
                artist, to the filter. The filter was ready to publish by 3pm
                that same day so it took me a little over 8 hours (I skipped
                breakfast and lunch!). Of course I spent another week perfecting
                thefilter and the butterfly movement but I wanted to have it
                ready on the same day and I posted the filter on my feed and
                left a comment under Kylie's last photo about the filter and
                also shared with Ariel that his makeup inspired the makeup in my
                filter. A few days later I got an email from the team and it was
                one of the best days of my life.

                Since this is such a niche industry, could you tell us a bit
                more about how things work - how does one attach a monetary
                value to a filter? And how much can artists expect to earn

                Since this is such a niche industry, could you tell us a bit
                more about how things work - how does one attach a monetary
                value to a filter? And how much can artists expect to earn
                through a filter (range)? AR filter creators with a coding
                background create very technical and complex filters and games.
                Graphic artists, painters and designers like myself combine our
                drawing skills with our knowledge of programming and 3D
                animation to create art that you can wear on your face. Just
                like any other work the value depends on the complexity and time
                it takes to complete. For my filters for example I like to start
                with drawing all themakeup elements in Illustrator and Photoshop
                and that alone requires many hours. And then I import everything
                I have created outside of Spark AR and begin the designing and
                coding process that is needed to complete the project. Filters
                can take between 1 day to weeks and even months when working
                with clients so it’s hard to give you a range as it really
                depends on what we are creating.

                Yes of course. I’ve worked with celebrities, influencers,
                businesses and brands.

              </p>
              <p class="csm-ans">
                The more skills the better! Like I wrote above I have a graphic
                design background and I’m also a painter and makeup artist so I
                bring together all these skills when I create my filters.
                Knowledge of coding and script is also a must.

                Several researchers are against such filters claiming it causes
                “Snapchat dysmorphia.” What’s your take on it?
              </p>
              <p class="csm-ans">
                My filters do not include facial warping or deformation. I do
                not change the shape or size of the users face or any of their
                facial features in my filters. This change is what causes the
                dysmorphia you describe and it’s actually banned in Instagram.
                In Novemver 2019 Instagram stopped approving filters relating to
                plastic surgery because they have been found to be harmful to
                mental health. People have become dissatisfied with their
                natural looks because they want to look like the filters with a
                smaller nose, bigger eyes and lips. The eyes, nose, lips and
                everything you see in my filters is your own. I add layers of
                makeup and shading that is completely achievable in real life
                with makeup asyou can see in my makeup photos that I post
                without using my filters. Although I don’t use this type of
                facial morphing in my filters I personally am not against it at
                all. I feel people should be free to decide what they would like
                to do with their face and filters should be fun and not taken
                seriously. I see nothing wrong with having bigger lips with a
                filter and in fact you don’t require plastic surgery to get
                bigger lips so I think Instagram should rethink their ban in the
                future and allow artists and users to make their own decision
                and choice.

                Women in the gulf region love heavy makeup and have been wearing
                the full glam face for years before it became so trendy on
                Instagram. I grew up admiring the beautifully drawn faces and
                eyes of women around me here. When I used to go home to Canada
                every summer everyone was more natural and wore a lot less
                makeup but I see that this is has definitely changednow and
                women everywhere are experimenting more with makeup.

                contouring my cheeks with different shades of bronzer and blush,
                using eyeliner and strip lashes to achieve dramatic eye looks
                and contouring my lips with lipliner, different shades of
                lipstick and adding lipgloss for a more plump look.

              <p class="csm-ans">
                It’s such an exciting time right now because people are

                can have or create their own filters too! This means that soon
                many Instagram users will have their own filter galleries. It’s
                definitely going to grow and get more complex by the day. I’m
                super excited and can’t wait to see where this will take me.

                I’ve always been the odd artistic one amongst serious number
                focused or technical individuals and I really enjoy bringing
                color and art into my interactions. I was the only Graphic
                Designer getting a Master’s Degree in Business Administration in
                my class (2004 Sauder School of Business at UBC Canada). And I
                often felt like my views about the importance of design,
                branding, color, made people roll their eyes simply because they
                didn’t understand what I was talking about or thought it was too
                easy or unimportant. I get this same feeling now with some of my
                peers in the Spark AR community who come from a coding
                background and can write very complex codes but don’t know
                anything about makeup and not too excited byit. But luckily I
                have found a group of amazing artists who are equally passionate
                about beauty filters and we enjoy exchanging tips and tricks and
                together our filters get hundreds of billions of impressions per
                week.
